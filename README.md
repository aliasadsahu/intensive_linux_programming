## Web Processing (LAMP Stack)

Use a bash script to download a url using wget 60 times in 1 hour 1 minute apart and run a python script on the file to extract data and insert it into a mySQL database. Then create a web facing php script that lives inside of an apache web server that fetches the data from the database and displays it to the user.

## Multi Core Programming

Using both point to point and collective methods execute a dot product function using multiple cores of the cpu
